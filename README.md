# Final-Degree-Project-code--Classification-Methods
Code for the  final degree project "Physics with Highly Displaced Muons at LHCb". The code uses Python in the ROOT framework and the Toolkit for Multivariate Algorithms, which implements two different classification methods: Multilayer Perceptron and Boosted Decision Trees. The goal is to train and apply the methods to a dataset of LHCb events in order to improve signal-background discrimination. The code was developed by Nadia Ghadban (physics degree student) with the help of the tutors Izaac Sanderswood and Fernando Mart√≠nez.
